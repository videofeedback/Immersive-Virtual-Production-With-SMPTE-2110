Abstract: In today’s film production, Virtual Production has emerged as a pivotal tool for enhancing the creativity of the talent and directors. It enables them to bypass guesswork and immerse themselves fully in a virtual environment, promoting creative expressions. However, the adoption of these real-time tools is not without high cost and challenges with unforeseen delays. These issues often manifest across the stages of pre-production and unintentionally in production, and post-production. The arrival of Immersive Virtual Production, featuring 180°-Stereo-3D @120fps , significantly increases complexity, leaving no room for inaccuracies. To achieve flawless outcomes, a novel workflow and new methodologies are necessary. This approach must not only address new demands but also fix previously recognized obstacles. Here, we demonstrate, without new full infrastructure investment, and expanding the pallet of tools, a noble method to create Virtual Production workflows that solves old and new challenges with SMPTE-2110, which acts as primordial glue, enabling a fully tuned and synchronized Virtual Production orchestra. This coordination ensures precise real-time visualization allowing improved post-production processes with the help of new AI tools for interpolation and API integration.
